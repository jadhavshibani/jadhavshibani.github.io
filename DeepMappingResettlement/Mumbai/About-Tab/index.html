Shaping [Re]settlement Ecologies: 
From repressive and neglected to inclusive and responsive citizenship in Mumbai.

Human settlements have evolved and transformed exponentially to cope with the needs, desires and aspirations of human beings. Inversely, these settlements continue  to influence the physical, social and psychological well being of human beings who dwell and interact with it.  The selective linking of favourable spaces through visible and invisible infrastructures, is simultaneously plowing the fields of human settlements to distance and disconnect local spaces and people. The process of [re]settlement, caused due to involuntary displacement of communities, has been a means to geographical and psychologically segregate previously marginalized citizens in Mumbai.  The concentration of the [re]settlement initiatives in Mumbai is a distortion, one that is built through a repetitive process of dispossession, that continually ruptures communities.  While the built form of the settlements should ideally represent its content and function, all of which are much more important than the form itself, the container of the initiatives fails to capture and reflect the needs and desires of its inhabitants.  This built form is thus a manifestation of the violent ecologies that is magnified through the process of [re]settlement, which in turn prolongs the initiation to co-produce an environment in solidarity.  Hence, how can the process of resettlement be shaped in order to alleviate socio-economic, spatial and environmental segregation of marginalised communities?

To productively disrupt the nuances of the process, there are two distinct paths that can be explored within the dimensions of [re]settlement.  One which radically resist the process of displacement and resettlement in far off locations, by realising alternatives to rehabilitate the communities within their existing contexts.  While, the second path is to recognize the ongoing process of [re]settlement, along with its complexities, in order to shape it in a way that benefits both, the governing agencies and the communities at threat.  Path two, not only opens up the possibilities to engage with past, present and future initiatives at the same time, but at the same time provides an opportunity to question its relevance in future.  Given the scale and urgency at which [re]settlement initiatives are being employed, this thesis acknowledges the process by collaborating with local organizations such as The Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers [ SPARC, India ], The National Slum Dwellers Federation [ NSDF ] and Mahila Milan [MM] “A decentralized network of poor women’s collective” in Mumbai.  My practice, thereby aims to critically engages with this urban process  to situate a scenario that alleviate socio-economical and spatial segregation of marginalised communities, rather than one that enforces an ecology of repression and neglect. 

In a sincere attempt to humanize the existing mechanisms, my practice indulges in three different interventions: the Deep Map, the Listening Archive and the Youth Program.  In order to holistically address the convoluted process of [re]settlement, the multidimensional interventions are built on both, the understanding of what it means to be resettled and the factors governing the socio-cultural, economical and environmental conditions of the human settlements.  The aim of Deep Map is to visualize the macro factors of the [re]settlement initiatives, that influences the ecologies of the given locations. This online, interactive map will serve as a tool for governing agencies, local organisations, activists and the beneficiaries to make informed decisions and to set criterias for the selection of a location for [re]settlement.  The Listening Archive is diagrammatic compilation of observations, experiences and reflections of the inhabitants of the existing resettlement initiatives, which were documented through extensive conversations and interactions over a period of two month in 2015.  On realising the depth and relevance of the Listening Archive, SPARC, India intends to use it as a tool not only to negotiate with the governing agencies to influence future initiatives, but also to engage with the existing initiatives to create meaningful spaces.  The sudden transition from horizontal to vertical settlements, along with added responsibilities and concerns is an astonishing leap of faith, a rupture that needs care and time to heal.  Designed to assist the beneficiaries in the initial phase of transition, the temporary [6 to 8 months] post [re]settlement Youth Program has a threefold objective: i. Provide guidance to cope with changes in everyday activities within the settlements.  ii. Instigate interaction and collaboration among the younger generation. iii. Provide a framework for horizontal transfer of knowledge across generations.  

The ways in which we, as humans perceive our own existence and relations is shaping the ever changing environment we dwell in. By shifting the focus from repressive and neglected ecologies to inclusive and responsive ecologies, my practice engages with the everyday life of the everyday people.
